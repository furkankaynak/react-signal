# React Signal

## Introduction

**React Signal** is a powerful state management library developed for React applications. This repository introduces an innovative approach to state management using Signals, providing an efficient alternative to traditional state management techniques. The primary goal is to enhance the predictability, scalability, and maintainability of React applications by simplifying the flow of data and automating updates across components.

## What is React Signal?

React Signal is a lightweight, event-driven state management library designed specifically for React applications. The core concept revolves around Signals, which are dynamic objects that efficiently manage and propagate changes across components. The library extends its functionality with Computed Signals and effects, offering an advanced solution for reactive and efficient state management.

## Why React Signal?

- **Efficiency**: React Signal minimizes the need for manual memoization, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for larger projects with complex data flows, providing an efficient and scalable state management solution.
- **React Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with React components, offering a responsive and efficient system for managing application state.

## Examples

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { signal, computed } from 'react-signal';

// Create a signal
const countSignal = signal(0);

// Create a computed signal
const doubledCount = computed(() => countSignal.value * 2, [countSignal]);

// React component using signals
const Counter = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {countSignal.value}</p>
      <p>Doubled Count: {doubledCount.value}</p>
      <button onClick={() => (countSignal.value += 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```
